Predicting medical insurance charges using regression techniques
# Insurance Cost Prediction using Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts medical insurance charges based on individual attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, gender, and region using regression techniques.

## Dataset
Medical Insurance Dataset containing demographic and health-related information.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature encoding and scaling  
4. Train-test split  
5. Linear Regression  
6. Ridge and Lasso Regression  
7. Residual analysis and visualization  
8. Model comparison and evaluation  

## Results
- Smoking, age, and BMI are the most influential factors.
- Regularized models improve stability.
- Residual analysis highlights model limitations and improvements.
